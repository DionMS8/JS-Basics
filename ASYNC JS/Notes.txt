[ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT]

ASYNCHRONICITY IN JS MEANS THAT IF JS HAS TO
WAIT FOR AN OPERATION TO BE COMPLETED, IT WILL
EXECUTE THE REST OF THE CODE WHILE WAITING

WE KNOW THAT FOR SYNCHRONOUS JS, EACH OPERATION
IS ADDED TO THE JS CALLSTACK AND JS MUST WAIT FOR
EACH OPERATION TO BE COMPLETE BEFORE MOVING FORWARD


FOR ASYNC JS, WEB APIS IN THE BROWSER TRACK AND MONITOR
SETTIMEOUT DELAYS AND EVENT LISTENERS WHILE THE CALLSTACK 
CONTINUES TO EXECUTE ALL OF THE OPERATIONS IN THE CODE
