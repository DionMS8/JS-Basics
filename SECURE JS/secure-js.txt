// JAVASCRIPT INJECTION

- THIS IS ONE WAY OF INJECTING JS INTO AN EXISTING WEB PAGE

<img src onerror = "alert("document.cookie")"

- WHEN AN IMG TAG IS ENCOUNTERED THAT HAS NO SRC LINK, AN ERROR WILL BE THROWN

- "ONERROR" CAN BE USED TO EXECUTE SOME UNWANTED CODE WHEN THIS ERROR OCCURS

- THIS QUERY WILL BE ADDED TO THE URL AND CAN POTENTIALLY BE SHARED FURTHER TO OTHER USERS WHO WILL ALSO ENCOUNTER THIS QUERY WHEN THEY VISIT THE WEBSITE 


IF THE FOLLOWING IS ENTERED:

<img src onerror = "alert("document.cookie")"

THIS WILL CAUSE A USER'S COOKIE DATA TO BE DISPLAYED AS AN ALERT. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM SINCE THE COOKIE FOLDER MAY CONTAIN THE USER'S SESSION ID, WHICH IS MADE UP OF THEIR USERNAME AND PASSWORD
